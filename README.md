# Building Block Transport
**Building Block Transportation** is a _crowdsourcing public transportation information platform_ that leverages blockchain technology to reward its users for the data they provide. It provides a series of "challenges" that involve sharing information about the transportation services, after you complete a certain challenge you'll receive certain amount of BTT coins (based on ethereum) as a reward, coins you can use to pay for the transportation service you are using.
## Inspiration
